0)  Rantings and ravings

    Disclaimer:  Just so it is understood, the "rantings and ravings" are
    my rantings and raving.  My readers are refined and sophisticated and
    would never rant or rave.  I, on the other hand, sit in front of the
    TV in torn underwear and drink beer out of the bottle.


    If you are interested in trying out BASIC-52, you won't be able to
    find much in the way of reference material. However, the good news
    is, is that the material available is top-notch. I've covered Jan
    Axelson's book in the past. This first rate book is based on the
    8052-BASIC chip, and is a must have for anyone (hobbyist or
    professional) who is planning on working with the 8051. However,
    Jan's book isn't a software reference book, it mostly covers
    hardware, interfacing, and programming technique.

    Another must have book, is "Basic-52 Programming" by Bruce Boyes,
    Will Bagley, and Scott Kendall of Systronix, Inc.  The book starts
    out with an introduction to BASIC-52 programming, program editing,
    and techniques.  About a hundred of the book's 160 pages are a
    detailed and quite useful reference of the commands and statements.
    Six appendixes covering advanced topics rounds out this most useful
    volume.  A quick index to commands, operators, and instructions
    printed on the back cover of the book is a nice finishing touch.  For
    only $20.00, it's a bargain at twice the price.  Well, let's not get
    carried away, but if you're programming in Basic-52, this book is
    indispensible.


    C-31 is a new cross compiler from SPJ Systems.  The full package
    which costs $150 (USD) includes a C compiler (ANSI compatible
    subset), assembler, source linker, and simulator (source code
    debugger).

    The compiler is a reasonable ANSI subset.  I tried a program from a
    project I'm working on (with the Dunfield compiler), and the compiler
    informed me that structures (struct) are not yet supported.  However,
    other programs I tried were more successful.

    Compiler features include:
       - support for floating point numbers
       - extensive collection of library routines
       - support for using Special Function Registers (SFR)
       - assembly language interface
       - asm keyword (for in-line assembly code)
       - peripheral keyword (allows specifying an address of a standard
         peripheral)

    The simulator is very nice.  It doesn't allow on-chip debugging, but
    it does allow source level debugging.  I tried a couple of sample
    programs (one of theirs and one of mine), and after I learned my way
    around the command structure, it worked beautifully.  Full support of
    breakpoints, tracing, etc.  A few memory mapped hardware peripherals
    are simulated including an LCD display, 8279 keyboard processor, and
    an 8255 parallel port.  (SPJ also has a plain simulator available as
    a separate product for assembly/machine code debugging.)

    A working demo of the compiler package, which includes the library
    sources and permits the compilation of small programs, is available
    from their web site.

    The documentation at the present is not very good.  I have been told
    that this is being worked on now, and in fact, should be finished by
    the time you read this.

    This is a new package with a few rough edges, but it easy to use, has
    a decent price, and has good potential.  Check out the demo on their
    web site and see for yourselves.

    Thinking about starting a project using an Atmel AT89C2051 Flash
    Microcontroller.  Good idea - it's got an unbelievably low price
    (about 2 bucks), and has got everything you need in a tiny package
    (20 pins).  But (there's always a but), what about a programmer?
    Well, there goes the low price.  BlowIT!  No, I'm not being rude...
    check out Silicon Studio's web site: http://sistudio.com They've got
    a simple, REALLY simple (2 transistors and 5 resistors), plan for a
    2051 programmer, called the BlowIT 2051.  Should cost all of about
    five or ten dollars.  A lot of you probably have most of the parts in
    your junk box.


    An interesting new MCU system based on the DS80C320 is available from
    CG Microsystems.  It has piles of features including 2 ISA slots.
    The price is about $90 (I forget the exact price) for the basic
    system.  Check out their web site for more information:
    http://home.earthlink.net/~cgmicro/


    If you're looking for a way to get away from the vicious EPROM
    program/try/cry/erase cycle, take a look at Chris Burkey's (KB8ZLI)
    web page.  You'll find plans for a cheap (about $10) and simple (4
    chips) ROM emulator.  I haven't tried it myself (no time), but this
    looks like a real worthwhile project on which to invest a few weekend
    hours.  The link is:
        ftp://ieee.cas.uc.edu/pub/electronics/software/burkey/


    Once upon a time, Barry Kauler developed a tiny operating system for
    the 8051, called TERSE.  Well, now it's been ported to the 8086, for
    the '186 class of microcontrollers and it's still tiny, but
    sophisticated (well, so's my wife for that matter) at about 1000
    bytes.

    His "K-Flow" design methodology got renamed, with the quite unlikely
    name of the "GOOFEE" methodology.  The accompanying book "Object
    Oriented Flow Design for Embedded Systems" has now grown up -
    twice the size (funny, so did my wife, she's pregnant), renamed to
    "Flow Design for Embedded Systems" and has been taken up by a major
    publisher:
         PUBLISHER: R&D Books / Miller Freeman (USA)
         ISBN:      0-87930-469-3
         WWW:       http://www.rdbooks.com/
         DATE:      1997
         DISTRIBUTED IN EUROPE BY: McGraw-Hill

    His CASE program, the GOOFEE Diagrammer, is bundled FREE with the
    book, and is now at version 1.1c with major enhancements.  It runs on
    Windows 3.1 and 95, and is a complete analysis/design and project
    management tool.  CASE software is very expensive, so his thinking is
    that something "for the rest of us" needs to be cheap.  I'm sure
    you'd agree with him that free with the book is cheap enough.

    For information on GOOFEE, look at the GOOFEE Systems Pty Ltd page:

    Gilad Barak wrote to me about his discovery of New Micros of Dallas
    Texas from an add in Circuit Cellar Ink.  They make various SBCs for
    various microcontrollers and add on boards (they have their own
    extension bus which allows piggyback mounting of several boards).

    He bought their NMIY0031 SBC, which is 8051 based, and from first
    impression he says it is something very nice for an unbeatable price.
    For $39 + shipping you get:  SBC with 8051 (Siemens SAB8051, can be
    substituted), 8K RAM, EPROM with a burnt-in monitor which supports
    downloading hex files into the RAM and executing them.  The board can
    accept 3 memory chips (each one up to 32K), one of which is for
    program, one for data and the third can be configured as wanted. It
    has a 4x5 matrix keyboard interface, LCD interface, RS232 and support
    for RS422/485 (need to add the chips). It also has a prototyping
    area of about 3.5 x 2 inches.

    On floppy you get:  User manual for the board in Word format and
    plain text format with many programming examples in all supplied
    languages (about 150 pages), A51 assembler, Small C compiler, hex
    file for the MCS-52 Basic interpreter EPROM with MCS-52 manual, hex
    file for MAX-FORTH interpreter EPROM with documentation, hex file for
    the supplied monitor and documentation, and a terminal program.

    For beginners, this system has the benefit of having everything
    needed in one package.


    Daniel Drennan is offering issue 1 of Inquisitor for free except for
    postage.  This issue contains plans, schematics, and troubleshooting
    tips for putting together a 8052-based microcontroller.  It is free
    except for the postage which is $1.00 in the United States; $2.00 for
    Canada and overseas surface mail; and $3.00 for overseas airmail.  If
    you're thinking of putting together an 8051 system, you might want to
    check this out.


    Thanks to Hans Schou for sending information on Intel's Universal
    Serial Bus, a 12Mbit/sec serial bus to be standard on all new Intel
    motherboards. The USB topology has three elements: host, hubs and
    functions. The PC is the host and the peripherals are the functions
    which need to interface via the USB to the PC. This is where the
    8x930Ax comes in. The 8x930Ax is an 8-bit microcontroller designed
    specifically for USB peripherals based on the MCS AE 251
    microcontroller architecture. It is the first USB microcontroller in
    a roadmap planned to include other Intel architectures and features
    throughout 1996 and beyond.

1)  ABOUT THIS FAQ

1.1)  Who put this FAQ together?

    I was prompted to put this FAQ together in response to my own
    frustration in searching for information, and to the constant
    occurrence of requests for information on this subject in various
    newsgroups.  Hopefully others won't need to go through what I did.

    Normally, I spend all day programming in assembler or C on an IBM PC.
    With my hobbyist hat on I decided to try my hand at a little
    microcontroller project design.  When it came time to start, I had no
    idea what to do.  I had nothing to start with - no assembler, no
    programming language, no simulator.  I cobbled together a simulator
    to help me learn about the workings of the chip.  It's not being made
    available to the public since I'm afraid the simulator isn't very
    good.  It was for my own use, so the user interface (there is none)
    really sucks eggs.

    I decided to search the net for information on the 8051.  This list
    was compiled the hard way, logging onto every anonymous ftp site I
    could find and looking around.  I also used Archie, other FAQs and
    lists, and every reference to the 8051 that appeared in the various
    news groups.  It took a long time till stuff finally started popping
    up.  I saved all of my notes and the result was the first version of
    this FAQ.  Responses have been pouring in, and the result is a much
    more complete and thorough FAQ.


1.2)  How can I contribute to this list?

    I please ask that if you have any suggestions or additions, or you
    would like to correct any of the information contained herein, please
    send me a note.

               Ginot Shomron
               ISRAEL

    The list of individuals who have sent suggestions and encouragement
    has finally overflowed.  I hope it suffices to say "Thank you to all
    who have contributed to this FAQ - we all appreciate it."

    Special thanks to recent contributors:

    I hope that those of you who know of interesting items for the 8051
    will share with everyone by contributing to this list.  Piles of
    stuff is turning up thanks to everyone's help.

    If you are a manufacturer and have an anonymous ftp site or BBS
    available that supports the 8051, please let me know by EMail so that
    I can add it to this FAQ.  Also, please feel free to update me on new
    products.


1.3)  What newsgroups will this FAQ be posted to?

    This FAQ will be posted to the following newsgroups:
          comp.sys.intel
          comp.realtime
          comp.robotics
          comp.lang.forth
          sci.electronics
    These newsgroups often contain discussions, announcements, or
    information on the 8051.  Check them out from time to time.

    The schedule for posting will be once a month.  I can't promise that
    it will be on time, but I hope to post it on the 26th of each month.

    You might also want to check out the following newsgroups, since they
    quite frequently have discussions about the 8051 and other
    microcontrollers:
          comp.arch.embedded
          alt.comp.hardware.homebuilt

    A bit farther afield, but still of possible interest:
          comp.lang.misc
          comp.ai.fuzzy
          comp.dsp
          sci.engr.control
          sci.engr.semiconductors


1.4)  May I post this FAQ to my local BBS?

    I am putting no restrictions on the use of this FAQ except - It must
    be distributed in its entirety with the copyright notice, and no
    financial gain may be realized from it.  After all, I have spent, and
    continue to spend, a lot of time on this.  The only thing that I
    intend to gain from it is more information on the 8051, and getting
    to know my fellow 8051 groupies better.

    For this reason I have appended a copyright statement to the end of
    this FAQ.  I feel pretty silly doing this, but I just want to protect
    myself.  The copyright does not limit the use of this list for
    noncommercial purposes.  I hereby give my permission to one and all
    to pass this list around and post it wherever you want - as long as
    it is not for financial gain.

        Thank you.


1.5)  How about FAQs on other microcontrollers?

    If anyone wishes to start a FAQ on another microcontroller, please
    feel free to copy the format of this FAQ - I don't intend on
    copyrighting the look and feel ;-).  With a common format, we will
    all benefit when trying to find information on a particular
    microcontroller.

2)  ABOUT THE 8051


2.1)  The 8051 microcontroller

    The 8051 is an 8 bit microcontroller originally developed by Intel in
    1980.  It is the world's most popular microcontroller core, made by
    many independent manufacturers (truly multi-sourced).  There were 126
    million 8051s (and variants) shipped in 1993!!

    A typical 8051 contains:
       - CPU with boolean processor
       - 5 or 6 interrupts: 2 are external
                            2 priority levels
       - 2 or 3 16-bit timer/counters
       - programmable full-duplex serial port
         (baud rate provided by one of the timers)
       - 32 I/O lines (four 8-bit ports)
       - RAM
       - ROM/EPROM in some models

    The 8051 architecture is a tad bizarre, but then so are the
    architectures of most microcontrollers due to their specialization
    (check out the PIC for creativity - for that matter, take a look at
    any RISC chip).  One vexing problem with the 8051 is its very
    non-orthogonal instruction set - especially the restrictions on
    accessing the different address spaces.  However, after some time
    programming the chip, you can get used to it - maybe even appreciate
    it.

    One strong point of the 8051 is the way it handles interrupts.
    Vectoring to fixed 8-byte areas is convenient and efficient.  Most
    interrupt routines are very short (or at least they should be), and
    generally can fit into the 8-byte area.  Of course if your interrupt
    routine is longer, you can still jump to the appropriate routine from
    within the 8 byte interrupt region.

    The 8051 instruction set is optimized for the one-bit operations so
    often desired in real-world, real-time control applications.  The
    boolean processor provides direct support for bit manipulation.  This
    leads to more efficient programs that need to deal with binary input
    and output conditions inherent in digital-control problems.  Bit
    addressing can be used for test pin monitoring or program control
    flags.


2.2)  8051 Flavors

    The 8051 has the widest range of variants of any embedded controller
    on the market.  The smallest device is the Atmel 89c1051, a 20 Pin
    FLASH variant with 2 timers, UART, 20mA.  The fastest parts are from
    Dallas, with performance close to 10 MIPS!  The most powerful chip is
    the Siemens 80C517A, with 32 Bit ALU, 2 UARTS, 2K RAM, PLCC84
    package, 8 x 16 Bit PWMs, and other features.

    Among the major manufacturers are:
        AMD      Enhanced 8051 parts (no longer producing 80x51 parts)
        Atmel    FLASH and semi-custom parts
        Dallas   Battery backed, program download, and fastest variants
        Intel    8051 through 80c51gb / 80c51sl
        Matra    80c154, low voltage static variants
        OKI      80c154, mask parts
        Philips  87c748 thru 89c588 - more variants than anyone else
        Siemens  80c501 through 80c517a, and SIECO cores
        SMC      COM20051 with ARCNET token bus network engine
        SSI      80x52, 2 x HDLC variant for MODEM use

    Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)

       AMD was one of the first manufacturers of enhanced variants
       including such features as:  dual data pointers, slave interface
       with arbitration unit, dual port RAM, FIFO buffers, and others.
       They are now out of the 8051 business.


    Atmel

       The smallest current device is the ATMEL 89c1051, a 20 Pin FLASH
       variant with 2 timers, UART, 20mA.  ATMEL was the first with
       standard pinout FLASH, and with more program cycles than other
       custom pinout FLASH.  These parts compete with OTP and MASK
       product on price, but eliminate inventory problems and the hidden
       costs of OTP development.  This will put real pressure on
       "vanilla" micros like PIC and ST6.


    Dallas Soft Microcontrollers - DS5000(T), DS5001(T), DS2250(T)

       The Dallas Soft Microcontrollers have standard 8051 cores with
       on-chip non-volatile RAM instead of ROM.  This gives the user the
       ability to easily alter the system and is perfect for data
       logging.  These processors are available in both chip and module
       solutions.  Among the features included in this family of
       products:
          - on-chip non-volatile RAM
          - loader in ROM for downloading programs (eliminates the hassle
            of EPROM erase/program/install cycle)
          - built in real time clock option
          - watchdog timer
          - software security (program and data encryption)

       The DS500x is a standard 40 pin DIP package (well, mostly
       standard, it is really a BOX which is about double the height of a
       normal chip).  The DS225x is a SIP version which is functionally
       identical to the DS5000 but usually a bit less expensive.

       The nice thing about having the RAM on-chip, is that the I/O ports
       are unaffected.  When the RAM is configured as CODE memory, the
       DS5000 behaves exactly as a single-chip 8051.  The NV-RAM is
       static with a built-in lithium battery, and has no limitations on
       the number of writes.  You can download your code as many times as
       you like without damaging the device.  The DS5000 also includes a
       loader in ROM, which permits you to bootstrap code into the RAM to
       get underway.  The loader and on-chip RAM have an encryption
       feature with which you can protect your code from being read back
       from the device if you wish.


    Dallas High-Speed Micros - DS80c320, DS87c520, DS87c530

       Real barn-burners - performance up to 10 MIPS!  Dallas was the
       first to speed up the core.  Wasted clock and memory cycles have
       been removed using a redesigned processor core.  As a result,
       every 8051 instruction is executed up to 3 times faster than the
       original for the same crystal speed.  Clock speeds from DC to
       33MHz!

       High performance doesn't just mean speed.  High integration gives
       the user 2 full-duplex hardware serial ports, 13 total interrupt
       sources (6 external), watchdog timer, power management, power-fail
       reset, and other features.


    Intel MCS-51

       Introduced in 1980, it has become the industry standard for
       embedded control.  Intel offers a wide variety of 8051 versions
       with different configurations of on-board EPROM/ROM.  Also low
       power, high integration, and specialized parts are also offered.


    OKI

       OKI makes an 85c154 piggyback - an 8751 but with an EPROM socket
       on top!  Great with an EPROM emulator.


    Philips

       Philips has more 8051 variants than anyone else.  Among the
       derivatives that they have:  40MHz, 24 pin skinny DIP, low
       voltage, quad flat pack (QFP) versions for saving board space,
       OTP, I2C bus, and so on.

       The c5xx line features high integration, with many built-in
       features including built-in EMI/RFI suppression.

       The c7xx series are very low-end, inexpensive micros.  They are
       offered with less memory (1k, 2k, etc.) and fewer features.  In
       fact the 83c750 sells for only $1 in very high OEM volumes.


    Siemens sab80c517a

       The 80c517a is one of the most powerful 8051 variants available.
       It features high clock speed (40 MHz), and high integration with
       32 Bit ALU, 2 UARTS, 2K RAM, PLCC84 package, 8x16 bit PWMs, and
       more.

2.3)  16-bit 8051 parts


    A joint project between Intel and Philips Semiconductors has resulted
    in two new excting products - 16 bit 8051s!  Due to a disagreement
    between the parties, they each went their separate ways.  Intel
    developed the MCS-251, which was originally called the ZX (this name
    can still be found on one of the Intel slide shows).  Philips came
    out with the eXtended Architecture (XA) line.

    The Intel MCS-251 is a drop-in replacement for the 8051 (at least,
    after programming the mode control bits first), and is also binary
    compatible.  The XA is more of a 16 bit micro which also happens to
    be source code compatible.  One can argue the merits of which
    approach is better.

    Pin compatible parts allow instant performance upgrades for existing
    designs, and the binary compatibility truly preserves users
    investment in code and tools.  By staying firmly in the 80x51 camp,
    Intel allows users transparent access to an enormous horsepower
    range.  To further improve throughput in numerically intensive areas,
    users can use INTEGER, LONGINT, and FLOAT libraries written for the
    MCS-251.  The Philips XA is not a drop-in replacement for the 8051.

    Binary code compatibility is nice, you can move right up to a more
    powerful engine without having to bust a gut (We all know the Intel
    binary compatible success story with their 80x86 microprocessors).
    But if you're working on a new design, how necessary is binary
    compatibility?  If you're just looking for a souped up '51, Dallas
    already has the 320.  If you need the advanced features, you'll need
    to recompile or rewrite your software anyhow.  You'll also have to
    drag along some compatibility baggage with you in order to use the 16
    bit operations - these are preceded by an escape code (A5H), the only
    instruction not used in the 8051 instruction set.

    With source code compatibility, you have to recompile your code (with
    a new set of development tools), since the instruction set has been
    recrafted to allow the biggest bang for the buck.  This process isn't
    100% transparent, but then again, binary compatibility isn't either.

    If you're upgrading an existing design, the 251 is probably your only
    reasonable choice (although you might also want to consider the
    Dallas 320).  On new designs, you'll have a tough decision to make.
    Whichever path you choose to take, the 8051 will never be the same
    again.


    Intel MCS-251

       The Intel MCS-251 is 100% binary and pin compatible with the 8051,
       but with a 5-15 times boost in horsepower.  This is achieved by a
       six fold gain in bus cycles, and further hardware improvements to
       avoid wasted bus cycles.

       Further performance gains are possible by recoding critical
       sections to take advantage of the new features:  powerful 8/16/32
       bit instructions, flexible 8/16/32 registers, 16MB linear address
       space, 16-bit stack pointer, enhanced BIT manipulations, and
       improved control instructions.  In addition to extra 16/32 bit
       instructions, the 251 includes 40 registers with Accumulator and
       Index functions overlayed as 16x8, 16x16, 10x32.

       Should we expect a 351 in the future.  How about a 451?  Or maybe
       a Penti-uC?


    Philips 8051XA

       By tossing compatibility out the window, Philips was able to
       develop a true 16 microcontroller while at the same time
       preserving the basic 8051 instruction set (source).  The benefits
       of this break with tradition result in a chip that has dual 16MB
       address spaces (data and code), multitasking support with task
       protected memory segments, a separate SFR bus, fast context
       switching, and optimized code efficiency.  Other features include:
       hardware divide and multiply (over 100 times faster than an 8051),
       32 vectored interrupts, 16 hardware exceptions, and 16 trap
       instructions.


2.4)  8051 representatives and approximate prices (in USD $)

    There are many, many varieties of 8051 out there.  This is only a
    small sampling of typical prices on Intel chips.

        8031 (128 bytes RAM)...................................3.59
        80C31 (CMOS version of previous).......................6.95
        8051AH (256 bytes RAM).................................6.95
        8051AHBASIC (w/Basic interpreter built in)............29.95
        8751 (4K EPROM, 128 bytes RAM)........................26.95
        87C51 (CMOS version of previous)......................39.95


2.5)  Common and New 80x51 variants

    Intel has announced that 8052AH-BASIC has reached its EOL (end of
    life) and is not any more in production. Resellers may still have
    some chips in stock. However, both source and object code is
    available in many ftp-sites (and Intel BBS) and can be loaded into
    any 8052-compatible internal ROM memory (or external ROM, but then
    PROG and DMA cannot be used).

    At least few years ago, MicroMint Inc. (4 Park St, Vernon,
    CT 06066, USA) was selling their own 80C52-BASIC at USD 25, speed DC
    12 MHz, CMOS.

2.6)  Advantages realized in implementing control applications on this
      family of microcontrollers

    Wildly popular - readily available and widely supported, a full range
    of free and commercial support products is available

    Fast and effective - the architecture correlates closely with the
    problem being solved (control systems), specialized instructions mean
    that fewer bytes of code need to be fetched and fewer conditional
    jumps are processed

    Low cost - high level of system integration within one component,
    only a handful of components needed to create a working system

    Wide range -  ONE set of tools covers the greatest horsepower range
    of any microcontroller family, other suppliers handle a number of
    DIFFERENT and INCOMPATIBLE (and often single-sourced) cores to cover
    the same power range as the 80x51, the 8051 provides a real cost
    savings in tools, training, and software support

    Compatibility - opcodes and binaries are the SAME for all 80x51
    variants (unlike most other microcontroller families)

    Multi-sourced - over 12 manufacturers, hundreds of varieties,
    something for everyone with the security of ready availability

    Constant improvements - improvements in silicon/design increase speed
    and power annually, 16 bit models coming from several manufacturers,
    low cost skinny DIP models now available


2.7)  Getting started

    If you are interested in getting started with the 8051, you will need
    to concern yourself with getting the appropriate hardware and
    software to develop your system.

    A good start would be to pick up a couple of books on the subject.
    Two really great books for beginners are "The Microcontroller Idea
    Book" by Jan Axelson (Lakeview Research) and "Programming and
    Interfacing the 8051 Microcontroller" by Sencer Yeralan and Ashutosh
    Ahluwalia (Addison Wesley).  Both books contain complete plans for
    microcontroller boards/systems if you plan on rolling your own.  The
    Yeralan/Ahluwalia books also contains a diskette with just about all
    of the software that you'll need to get started progamming for the
    8051 (assembler, simulator, etc).  These books also have many circuit
    and code examples and are very useful for the beginner (I'm going to
    need an extra copy of each for reading in the bathroom :-).


    Which software you choose is mostly a matter of personal preference,
    how much time you have to invest, how much money you have to invest,
    and what you want to accomplish.  Serious work can be accomplished
    using much of the free software listed in this FAQ, however in most
    cases technical support is unavailable.  Registering shareware, or
    buying a mainstream commercial package gives you backup and support
    and helps you get going much faster.

    If you are a hobbyist or student, and would like to program in C, I
    would recommend looking at the Dunfield Development System.  I use
    this package and it is a powerful package for only $100.  It includes
    a full suite of development tools including C compiler, assembler,
    linker, and much more.  A hardware-resident simulator/emulator is
    available for an additional $50.  Another C compiler package from
    Micro Computer Control provides similar capabilities for the same
    price.

    A wide range of development options exists for all budgets and
    purposes.  One convenient way to start is the Ceibo/Philips DS-750
    development system, based on the 80c75x (a scaled down 8051 variant).
    The "emulator" board programs the chips (so you won't need an EPROM
    programmer and the debugger has a user interface much like Borland's
    Turbo Debugger.

    The development system that I use is based on the Dallas DS5000.  The
    nice thing about the DS5000 is that you can upload your programs
    directly to the chip (no EPROM needed!).  The Dunfield package
    provides excellent support for this chip, including plans for
    building a "pseudo-ice".  With this setup, all you need to do is
    upload your program, and debug (emulate) on the target hardware.
    This setup is highly recommended.


    One other possibility is the 8052AH-BASIC chip.  With a Basic
    interpreter built in, you have an interactive development system when
    attached to your PC.  Jan Axelson's book gives complete coverage on
    this chip, including plans to build your own system, programming in
    Basic, and interfacing to various peripherals and devices.


2.8)  Technical Questions and Answers

    Q:  Why are ports P0 and P2 unavailable for I/O when using external
        memory?

    A:  The output drivers of ports 0 and 2, and the input buffers of
        port 0, are used to access external memory.  Port 0 outputs the
        low byte of the external memory address, time-multiplexed with
        the byte being read/written.  Port 2 outputs the high byte of the
        external memory address when the address is 16 bits wide.
        Otherwise, the port 2 pins continue to emit the P2 SFR contents.
        Therefore, when external memory is being used, ports 0 and 2 are
        unavailable for their primary use as general I/O lines.


    Q:  Is there anything I can do to use these ports for I/O when using
        external memory?

    A1: Not really.

    A2: If you really want to make your life miserable, you can try to
        use P2 for output when it isn't being used for memory access.
        The contents of the SFR latch for port 2 are not modified during
        the execution of a Data Memory fetch cycle on the Expanded Bus.
        If an instruction requiring a cycle on the Expanded Bus is not
        followed by another instruction requiring a cycle on the Expanded
        Bus, then the original contents of the port 2 SFR latch will
        appear during the next machine cycle.  That is, when PSEN, RD and
        WR are all inactive, you can use port 2 for output (check the
        timing charts in the data book).  The chip will emit the contents
        of the P2 SFR at that time.  Do you REALLY want to bother with
        this though?

    A3: By including the external RAM "on-chip", the Dallas DS5000 makes
        these ports available for I/O.  The SLIC E2 from Xicor does the
        same thing for other 8051 parts.

    A4: If you really need the extra I/O ports, there are number of 8051
        variants that have additional ports.  Philips and Siemens are two
        such manufacturers that have these parts in their product lines.


    Q:  I'm outputting a 1 to a pin on port 0, but I'm not getting a 1
        out.  If I use a pin on port 1 instead, it works fine.  What am I
        doing wrong?

    A:  Port 0 has open drain outputs.  Ports 1, 2, and 3 have internal
        pullups.  What does this mean?  See the next question and answer.


    Q:  Port 0 has open drain outputs.  Ports 1, 2, and 3 have internal
        pullups. What does this mean, and why should I care?

    A:  When used as outputs, all port pins will drive the state to which
        the associated SFR latch bit has been set.  Except for port 0,
        which will only drive low (not high).  When a 0 is written to a
        bit in port 0, the pin is pulled low (0).  But, when a 1 is
        written to a bit in port 0, the pin goes into a high impedance
        state - or in other words, "disconnected", no value.  To be able
        to get a 1 as output, you need an external pullup resistor to
        pull up the port (to 1) when the port is in its high impedence
        state.  Typical values for pullups might be 470 ohm to drive a
        LED, and 4.7K or higher to drive logic circuits.

    C:  Any port pin may be used as a general purpose input simply by
        writing a 1 into the associated SFR latch bit.  Since ports 1, 2,
        and 3 have internal pull-up devices they will pull high and will
        source current when pulled low.  When a port 0 bit is programmed
        for input (set to 1) it will go to a high impedance state.


    Q:  Why is such an oddball crystal frequency of 11.0592 MHz used so
        often for 8051 designs.

    A1: 11.0592 MHz crystals are often used because it can be divided to
        give you exact clock rates for most of the common baud rates for
        the UART, especially for the higher speeds (9600, 19200).
        Despite the "oddball" value, these crystals are readily available
        and commonly used.

    A2: When Timer 1 is used as the baud rate generator, the baud rates
        in Modes 1 and 3 are determined by the Timer 1 overflow rate and
        the value of SMOD (PCON.7 - double speed baud rates) as follows:

                            smod
                           2
           Baud rate =   ------   x (Timer 1 overflow rate)
                           32

        Most typically, the timer is configured in the auto-reload mode
        (mode 2, high nibble of TMOD = 0100B).  In this case, the baud
        rate is given as:

                            smod
                           2        Oscillator frequency
           Baud rate =   -------  x --------------------
                           32         12 x (256 - TH1)

        Some typical baud rates for an 11.0592 crystal:

           Baud rate  SMOD   TH1
           ---------------------
             19200      1   0FDH
              9600      0   0FDH
              4800      0   0FAH
              2400      0   0F4H
              1200      0   0E8H
               300      0   0A0H

        Another way to look at it, would be to rework the formula to give
        us the crystal frequency that we need for the desired baud rate:

                                                        smod
        Minimum crystal frequency =  Baud rate x 384 / 2

        This gives us the minimum crystal frequency possible for the
        desired baud rate.  The frequency can be evenly multiplied to
        obtain higher clock speeds.

        As an example, the minimum crystal frequency for 19.2K baud is:
              3.6864 = 19200 x 384 / 2 (smod is 1 for 19.2K baud)

              11.0592 = 3.6864 x 3


        To determine the timer reload value needed, the formula can be
        changed to factor in the multiplier:
                                                             smod
        Crystal frequency = Baud rate x (256 - TH1) x 384 / 2


        From the example above, the multiplier (3) is used to determine
        TH1:
              TH1 = 256 - 3 = 253 = 0FDH

        The crystal frequency for 19.2K baud is:
              11.0592 = 19200 x (256 - 0FDH) x 384 / 2
                      (smod is 1 for 19.2K baud)


        Other values can also give good results, but 11.0592 is one of
        the higher speed crystals that allows high baud rates.

    A:  Well, you wanta talk about oddball values?  Another good crystal
        value is 7.3728 MHz and its multiples. Using counter1 this gives
        an even 38.4 kbps rate exactly, which is not possible with
        11.0952 MHz Xtal. <Thanks to Eero-Pekka Mand>


    Q:  How do I decrement the data pointer (DPTR)?  Where did the DEC
        DPTR instruction go?

    A1: You can't decrement DPTR.  Although there is an INC DPTR
        instruction, there is no DEC DPTR.  In fact, there is no other
        way to change the contents of DPTR except for MOV and INC.

    A2: You can use the accumulator as an offset if you need to perform
        "calculations" on the DPTR.  As an example:
              MOV   DPTR,#9000         ; load base address into DPTR
              MOV   A,#10              ; load desired offset
              MOVC  A,@A+DPTR          ; retrieve desired data

    A3: Another method would be to use indirect addressing.  Instructions
        such as MOVX A,@Ri can address a 256 byte "page" of external RAM.
        The value represented by @Ri (@R0 or @R1) is emitted to Port 0,
        which is the low byte of the external RAM address bus.  In
        addition, the contents of the P2 register is emitted to Port 2,
        which is the high byte of the external memory address bus.  The
        indirect addressing register together with the P2 register, which
        specifies the "current page number", gives us a 16 bit pointer
        into the external memory address space.

        This technique can make moving data in external memory much
        faster than reloading DPTR every time.  The indirect addressing
        register can be manipulated much easier than DPTR which can only
        be loaded and incremented.  Just remember to make sure that P2
        contains the proper value for the high byte of the address.

    A4: Inside the BASIC interpreter source code, and published in its
        manual, is a short and efficient subroutine to decrement data
        pointer, only 6 statements:
            XCH A,DPL ; JNZ $+4 ; DEC DPH ; DEC A ; XCH A,DPL ; RET
        Only DPTR is affected, not A or any flags!
        <Thanks to Eero-Pekka Mand>


    Q:  I'm trying to PUSH and POP the accumulator, but my assembler
        complains about the instruction  PUSH  A.  What's wrong with
        this?

    A:  In instructions that are accumulator specific, A is used to
        represent the accumulator.  However, PUSH and POP have no
        accumulator specific forms, only direct addressing forms.
        Therefore, you need to specify the correct accumulator "address"
        - ACC.  Use the instruction PUSH ACC.


    Q:  The 8052 AH-BASIC interpreter seems to work OK when I perform
        simple interpreted commands.  For example:
             READY
             > PRINT "HELLO"
             HELLO
        However, when I try to enter a [numbered] statement, I get an
        error:
             READY
             > 10 PRINT "HELLO"
             INVALID LINE NUMBER..!!
        I get the same error when I try LIST.  No matter what value I set
        a variable to, it returns a 0.  What's my problem?

    A1: Faulty memory decoding or addressing is the most common cause for
        this error message.  This happens when RD/WR is affecting two (or
        more) active memory chips. So, decode each CS very carefully!

    A2: Your address decoding might also indicate that there is more
        memory than really exists.  Go over your circuit design and
        inspect your wiring carefully.


    Q:  Can I use C for time critical code?

    A:  The code produced by many of the excellent compilers today, is
        remarkably efficient - for both speed and size.  Modern compilers
        are quite adept at keeping track of register and variable usage.
        Further optimization techiniques result in code that can be as
        good or better than hand written assembler.  Even for ISRs
        (interrupt service routines), C should be acceptable for all but
        the most time critical routines.

        Makes you think twice about breaking your head over assembly
        code.


    Q:  The Intel MCS-51 assembly language defines alternate symbols AR0
        ... AR7 for registers R0 ... R7.  What is this good for? (Thanks
        to Wolfgang Heinz who submitted this Q & A)

    A:  Some 8051 instructions do not support all possible addressing
        modes.  For example, the PUSH and POP instructions are only
        available with direct addressing. Since the registers R0 ... R7
        are mapped into the internal memory, they must also have a DATA
        (= direct) address.  The special assembler symbols AR0 ... AR7
        are simply the absolute DATA addresses of registers R0 ... R7.
        Although there is no instruction PUSH R5 with true register
        addressing, you can do it with PUSH AR5 (= direct addressing)!

    Q:  Usually the 8051 register banks are switched with the RS0 and RS1
        bits in the status register PSW at runtime.  But how is it
        possible to switch the banks at assembly time with the USING
        instruction, implemented in so many 8051 assemblers?
        (Thanks to Wolfgang Heinz who submitted this Q & A)

    A:  Not at all!  This must ALWAYS be done with bits RS0 and RS1 at
        runtime.  The USING instruction switches only the absolute DATA
        addresses of the special assembler symbols AR0 ... AR7 according
        to the selected bank number.  With most assemblers that implement
        relocatable segments and object modules, the linker is forced to
        reserve space for the corresponding register bank in the internal
        memory.


    Q:  The Intel 8x151/8x251 won't "drop-in" for an 8051. What gives?

    A:  You need to use a programmer to set a couple bits to the correct
        state.  This info is hidden away in an app note available from
        their fax-back service.

4)  8051 PRODUCTS

    This section includes descriptions and references to free and
    commercial software for the 8051.  FTP sites and BBSs contain many
    quality packages and code samples for free.  For heavy duty use, you
    might prefer the many commercial packages that are available.  With
    the public domain (or free) stuff, you're usually on your own.  The
    commercial packages usually provide extensive documentation and
    support.


4.1)  Free languages and development tools

    The following is a list of the languages and development tools that I
    could find on the net.  Nearly all of them include source code,

      Comments:  These two programs together constitute a bare-bones
                 method of developing 80C51 system code without an
                 emulator.  RISM51X is installed in the target system
                 and connected to a host PC system through a serial port.
                 The host PC runs the debugger IECM51.EXE.  Once the
                 system has been debugged, RISM can be removed and the
                 target can be run in stand-alone mode.

4.2)  Free C compilers

    Several commercial C compilers have evaluation versions available.
    These are not too useful (even for hobbyist projects) since they
    usually don't include libraries.  However, they do afford the user
    the chance to inspect the quality of the code generated.  Among those
    currently available:

        Franklin Softwares evaluation package is available at:
           http://www.fsinc.com
        The assembler permits you to make modules up to 1K of code, the
        compiler up to 2K, and the linker will link those together and
        generate a program up to 4K in size. The package is fully
        Windows, Win95, and NT compliant. It includes libraries (with
        strings, math, even floating point), a debugger/simulator,
        project manager, built-in make, assembler, linker, compiler, and
        object to HEX converter.

        Many of the other software manufacturers also offer evaluation
        versions of their C compilers. Check out their web sites and see
        what you can find.

    There were a couple of freeware 8051 compilers in the works, but it
    seems as if they didn't pan out.  At least for now, you'll have to
    pay to get an 8051 C compiler.

    In most cases, it makes more sense to invest a bit, and get something
    serious.  Also, by buying a commercial package, you have the
    advantage of having the documentation, and being able to get
    technical support.  As Hershel Roberson says about the Dunfield
    package, "It is certainly worth the money. It is probably 3/4 as good
    as compilers that cost 10 times as much!"

    There are two low-cost C compilers currently available for 8051
    development:

    I've been using the Dunfield Development System, and its really quite
    nice.  I've also heard many good things about it from others.  For
    $100 you get a near ANSI-C compiler, run-time library with source,
    assembler, ROM debugger, integrated development environment, monitor
    with source, utilities, and other extras.  A high quality simulator
    for only $50 is also available separately.  The simulator has an
    option allowing you to interface to your target by using an on-chip
    monitor.  Although not freeware, the low price, the features, all of
    the extra goodies, and the good reviews make this a package worth
    looking at.  Also, if you're interested in working on more than one
    family of microcontroller, Dunfield supports a wide range.  This
    means only needing to learn one system, instead of many.

    Another low priced ($100) C compiler comes from Micro Computer
    Control.  This package was unavailable for review, but according to
    the manufacturer, it features:  Cross compilers running under DOS are
    available for the 8051 and the Z8 (including Super-8).  This package
    includes a C compiler, assembler, linker, librarian, and extensive
    printed documentation.  A simulator/source code debugger is available
    for an additional $79.95.  The simulator is completely configurable,
    so much so that you don't even need the target hardware to test with.
    You can configure all I/O and other features of your target chip or
    environment.

    Emulators ($$$ - high, $$ - medium, $ - low priced)
      <Thanks to Alistair George for this bit of important advice...
      Potential customers of emulators should check to make sure that the
      emulator supports the required external hardware (ports,
      interrupts, etc) before they buy - its probably the most
      important spec, but one easily missed. Some emulators only offer
      very minimal support, which sometimes hardly makes it worthwhile to
      bother.>

5.2.2)  Book reviews

    My review of the book:
    Programming and Interfacing the 8051 Microcontroller
    by Sencer Yeralan and Ashutosh Ahluwalia

       Addison-Wesley has just released a GREAT new book, "Programming
       and Interfacing the 8051 Microcontroller" by Sencer Yeralan and
       Ashutosh Ahluwalia.  I had actually reviewed the manuscript some
       time back, and the book has now finally been released.  This book
       contains a wealth of information - it answers a lot of Frequently
       Asked Questions that often appear in comp.robotics,
       sci.electronics, and comp.arch.embedded.

       Among the some of the basic subjects covered include: 8051
       architecture, programming basics and techniques, on-chip features,
       building your own 8051 system, and interfacing to various
       peripherals.  A section on hardware experiments contains plans and
       code for:  scanning a keypad, stepper motor control, a frequency
       generator, measuring light and temperature intensity (analog to
       digital), digital to analog conversion, DC motor speed regulation,
       interfacing to intelligent Liquid Crystal Displays, and
       implementing a multi-drop RS-485 network.

       The book comes with a diskette containing an 8051 simulator and
       all source code for the projects in the book.  This is a must have
       book for the hobbyist or professional.  Available for $34.38, 352
       pages, paperback, ISBN 0-201-63365-5.  Run, don't walk, to your

    My review of the book:
    The Microcontroller Idea Book
    by Jan Axelson

       This book is loosely based on a series of articles Jan wrote for
       ComputerCraft magazine (now the Microcomputer Journal).  If you
       are at all familiar with her work, you already realize that you're
       wasting your time by reading this review and you might as well
       just order your copy now.

       This is an excellent book for hobbyists and tinkerers, as it
       includes complete circuit schematics and parts lists, design
       theory, example program listings, construction and debugging tips,
       and vendor listings.  The example circuits and programs are based
       on the 8052-BASIC chip (a favorite with hobbyists due to its ease
       of use), and there is a lot of material on programming in BASIC52.
       The book is [very] useful even if you use a standard 8051 part.
       Lots of different interfacing ideas including: sensors, motors,
       LEDs, LCDs, wireless links, and a LOT more.

       Chapter titles:  microcontroller basics, inside the 8052-
       BASIC, powering up, saving programs, programming, inputs and
       outputs, switches and keypads, displays, using sensors to
       detect and measure, clocks and calendars, control circuits,
       wireless links, calling assembly-language routines, running
       BASIC-52 from external memory, related products

       If you are just starting out with microcontrollers, and don't have
       a clue where to start or what to control, this book is just what
       you need.  As the title of the book says, it's an idea book.

    My review of the book:
    The 8051 Family of Microcontrollers
    by Richard H. Barnett

       This book VERY thoroughly discusses the design and implementation
       of controllers using the 8051.  Dick says his book is "lots of
       meat, very little filler", but he's a bit off the mark here.  What
       he means to say is this book is many large chunks of meat, no
       vegetables, and no potatoes - we are NOT talking Hamburger Helper
       here gang.  The introduction alone contains circuits for 3
       controllers (one 8085 design used as a comparison).  Many hardware
       and softare examples are included.  Everywhere you turn in this
       book, you'll find circuit diagrams and sample code, including
       complete designs for three different microcontroller projects in
       the last chapter.  Clear and in-depth coverage of interfacing and
       peripheral use leaves very little to the imagination.

       This is a good book for both students and professionals who are
       trying to figure out how to start designing there own
       microcontroller.  Experienced hobbyists will also appreciate the
       many examples.  Novices might be a bit overwhelmed by this book.

    Richard Kendrick's review of the book:
    8051 Interfacing and Applications
    from Applied Logic Engineering

       IN BRIEF

       An excellent collection of interfacing circuits and well commented
       source code in assembly.  This is not a book for beginners as it
       assumes the user is very familiar with the architecture of the
       8051 and its registers.  A disk of assembly source code listings
       is included.

       CHAPTERS

             1    - 8051 Interfacing and Applications

       COMMENTS

       This spiral bound book is thin (74 pages) but manages to cover a
       lot of information.  All of the sub-chapters have excellent code
       listings with full comments, partial schematic diagrams, and an
       occasional timing diagram.  The chapter on using the serial port
       is based on the MAX232 chip becoming so popular.  A table of timer
       reload values is provided to get standard baud rates but the book
       only mentions the required clock frequency of 11.0592 mHz in the
       first chapter.  It also doesn't explain why a seemingly
       non-standard crystal frequency was chosen.  The dual UART channel
       features the 2681 chip.  The LCD chapter gives a small but
       adequate explaination of the Hitachi controller chip usage on LCD
       displays and a tiny fragment of data on display characteristics of
       LCDs.  The bank selection of memory is useful showing code and
       schematic using five 62256 chips for 160K bytes of read/write
       memory.


    Richard Kendrick's review of the book:
    Microprocessor/Controller Design
    by Wayne P. Lichti of Business Data Computers

       A lame little book better bypassed.  As an introductory text,
       Kenneth Ayala's book is the winner hands down.  This book is a
       poor rehash of the same information in Intel's or AMD's data book.
       There is one code listing in the book and does little more than
       tell the reader that the 8051 family of processors exist.

       This book is 134 pages of wasted time.  The schematics were
       printed on a dot matrix printer and poorly reproduced.  Many of
       the sections are just a table or a paragraph with two or three
       sentences.  Use Ayala's book, you'll learn a lot more useful
       information.


    John Little's review of the book:
    The 8051 Microcontroller: Architecture, Programming and Applications
    by Kenneth J. Ayala

       IN BRIEF

       A good book for those who are already moderately familiar with
       assembly language programming and wish to learn more about 8051
       specifics.  Has many example listings, all of which are very well
       documented in terms of comments and explanations in the text. NOT
       a book for absolute beginners OR hardware hackers looking for
       circuits and applications.

       COMMENTS

       In his preface to the book, Mr Ayala states that that it is
       intended for "... a diverse audience. It is meant for use
       primarily by those who work in the area of electronic design and
       assembly language programming of small, dedicated computers".
       Later, he goes on to refer the reader to the manufacturer's data
       books for more information on hardware issues. This sets the tone
       for the whole book, which is very much software orientated.

       Anyone buying the book expecting to find reams of circuit diagrams
       and details on how to build their own 8051 driven, automated car
       assembly plant will be disappointed. In fact, most of the circuits
       and applications shown are very much conceptual, with generic,
       black-box outlines for most of the components. The single
       exception to this is a fairly complete system (8031, EPROM & RAM,
       jumper selectable memory sizes) in the chapter on microcontroller
       design.  Even then, there's no I/O shown (the txd/rxd are
       unconnected).

       Having said that, Mr Ayala does do a fairly thorough job of
       working through the peculiarities of the 8051, with detailed
       coverage of memory organisation, bit/byte level operations,
       timers, interrupts and, at the end of the book, a complete chapter
       on 8051 communication modes. Each area has relevant assembly
       language listings, along with a detailed explanation of the
       workings of the code.

       Each section also has highlighted "comment" passages which point
       out common pitfalls and reinforce critical points. Each chapter
       ends with a summary of the important points covered and a series
       of ten to twenty pertinent problems for the reader to solve. For
       the most part, the answers to the problems can be found in the
       text.  In later chapters though, the reader is asked to elaborate
       on various programming themes and to write assembly language
       programs of their own to perform various tasks. The problems range
       from the bland "Name twenty items which have a built in
       microcontroller" (Chapter 1), to the more esoteric "Compose a
       40-value lookup table that will generate a sawtooth wave using a
       D/A converter" (Chapter 8).

       It should be noted that the book is not aimed at the complete
       novice. For instance, although assembly language listings are used
       throughout, it is not until Appendix B that the reader finds out
       what the assembler actually does and how the listings relate to
       machine code. Even then, the complete neophyte will be left with a
       rather empty feeling, as there are pages and pages of code, the
       schematic for a (more or less) complete system and instructions on
       how to use the assembler, but no information at all on how the
       object code should be utilised (other than with the included
       simulator - see below). If you don't already know how to blow an
       EPROM, you're in trouble.

       The diskette which accompanies the book contains the PseudoSam
       assembler (which is used throughout) and an 8051 simulator. Both
       being intended for use on a PC (it's a measure of how fast the
       computer industry is evolving that a 5.25 inch diskette seems a
       little archaic just three years after the publication date of the
       book).  The PseudoSam assembler ran fine on my system and I was
       able to assemble several of the examples from the book and
       successfully run them on a small, home-brew 8031 system. I was
       totally unable to get the simulator to run. However, as it failed
       on several different systems I'm prepared to believe that my
       particular copy of the diskette was at fault.


       SUMMARY

       All in all, a recommended book for those who have previous
       assembly language experience and wish to get to know details
       relating to the 8051 microcontroller. While the internal
       architecture of the chip is covered in detail, external hardware
       and peripheral interfacing is not.  Only the basic 8051/31 is
       covered, with little mention of the other variants available.
       There are extensive listings in the text, covering routines for
       handling keyboards and displays, as well as timing loops and
       communications. A large, clear typeface ensures that all of the
       listings are completely legible. The layout and presentation of
       the book is excellent, with a consistent, unambiguous style used
       throughout.


    Tim McDonough's review of the book:
    C and the 8051: Programming for Multitasking
    by Thomas W. Schultz

       Schultz's book provides a brief overview of the 8051 architecture
       but is primarily a discussion of multi-tasking software in an 8051
       environment.  He presents quite a few code examples.  The examples
       and the accompanying text show comparisons of how to accomplish
       things in assembler, PLM, and C.  The C examples presented are
       based on Version 3 of the Franklin compiler but should be easily
       understandable by anyone already familiar with C.

       Later chapters in the book deal with more advanced topics.
       Chapters are devoted to Real-Time Ideas, Timing and Scheduling,
       Communications and Synchronization, Interrupts, Priority, and
       Context, and Distributed Systems.  The Real-Time Ideas chapter
       briefly discusses six Real Time Operating System (RTOS) kernels
       offered by several vendors.  Later in the book some examples are
       given to simple applications with and without using a RTOS.

       All in all, a useful addition to my technical library.  It is one
       of the few 8051 books that goes beyond the basics and would be
       particularly of interest to those contemplating their first
       non-trivial 8051 design.
